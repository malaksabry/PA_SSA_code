This study utilized CT imaging data and catheter-based measurements from the Aswan Heart Centre and the ASPIRE registry. Due to ethical and legal constraints, these datasets contain potentially identifiable or sensitive patient information and therefore cannot be made publicly available. Interested researchers may request access to the ASPIRE registry by contacting [insert contact or link]. Access to data from the Aswan Heart Centre will require appropriate institutional data transfer agreements.
The matrices of PCA shape mode coefficients, along with their corresponding mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) values, are publicly made available on this repository.
•	The PCA modes matrix from the simple encoding, along with corresponding mPAP values is 'all_simple_encoding.xlsx'.
•	The PCA modes matrices from the complex encoding, along with corresponding mPAP values, are divided into 'AHC.xlsx' and 'ASPIRE.xlsx'.
•	The 'Statistics.py' python code can be used to run the statistical analyses available in the paper.

The two encoding methods employed in this study are also available for public use:
•	Complex encoding: https://github.com/PauR0/PA_SSA
•	Simple encoding: https://github.com/uhermida/ComputationalAnatomyFetal
